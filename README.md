# MyECart-Django_project
Ecommerce website from Scratch using Django Framework

The MyECart is a Django application which will allow the merchant to advertise and sell their goods on the internet. 
The main goal of this project is to create an e-commerce web portal with a content management system which would allow product information to be updated securely. The web portal will have an online interface in the form of an ecommerce website that will allow users to buy goods from the merchants.The e-commerce portal will have the following key features:
● An online shop that will allow online shoppers to buy wares from formal and informal merchants.
● A search engine on the website to allow customers to find specific types of merchandise.
● A secure login system that will allow shoppers to purchase goods safely.
● A database of merchandise with photos, product descriptions and product categories. This database will also contain all relevant merchant and customer feedback.
